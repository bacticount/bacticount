    <string name="tutorial_1of4_text_view_intructions1"><b>1. Calibrating BACTICOUNT to count bacterial DNA in a blood sample.</b> You\'ll need known concentrations of genomic DNA samples arranged like so on a hotplate: </string>
    <string name="tutorial_1of4_text_view_intructions2"><b>2. </b>Place hotplate under a sealed box with radial UV LED\'s attached to the top and a viewfinder-sized hole for this camera.</string>

    <string name="tutorial_2of4_text_view_intructions4"><b>4.</b> Attach blue-blocking lens filter to this camera, put phone on box, and prepare tape to secure phone during recording. Proceed to "Start" from the home screen, then "record standard curve".  Follow the instructions until the 70-minute recording is complete.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_3of4_button_to_page_4of4">Aiite. Don\'t bore me to death :P</string>
    <string name="tutorial_3of4_text_view_intructions">5. Now that you\'ve successfully recorded a calibration standard curve, complete the same procedure for a set of unknown live blood samples (still use a [+] and [-] control) by going to "record sample" from "start" on the home screen. After this 70 minute recording is complete, you\'re ready to analyze the results! \n \n <b>6. Using BACTICOUNT to count bacteria in a blood sample.</b> From "start" go to "select and view results".  Here you\'ll be prompted to choose both a calibration (.pasc) and set of unknowns for analysis (.pasc).  Simply select one from the prompted folders of the run names you recorded earlier, and hit "proceed". Results will be displayed, in powers of 10 for each of the 8 unknown vials alongside checks for [+] and [-] controls (required to pass for calibrations and unknown samples). They are exported to the same folder (*_analysis.txt) for viewing or verification, along with raw data from all recordings.</string>
